Introduction:

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This tool provides a straightforward implementation to demonstrate how Caesar Cipher works in practice.
Features

    Encryption: Encrypt any message with a specified shift value.
    Decryption: Decrypt an encrypted message with the same shift value used for encryption.
    Interactive CLI: Easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

Usage:

To use the Caesar Cipher tool, run the Python script (caesar_cipher.py) in your preferred Python environment. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt messages interactively.
Commands

    Encrypt: Enter 'E' to encrypt a message.
    Decrypt: Enter 'D' to decrypt a message.
    Quit: Enter 'Q' to exit the program.

  Examples
Encrypting a Message:
.Enter 'E' for encryption, 'D' for decryption, or 'Q' to quit: E
.Enter the message you want to encrypt: Hello, World!
.Enter the shift value (a positive integer): 3
.Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!

Decrypting a Message:
.Enter 'E' for encryption, 'D' for decryption, or 'Q' to quit: D
.Enter the message you want to decrypt: Khoor, Zruog!
.Enter the shift value used for encryption: 3
.Decrypted message: Hello, World!
